# PSF-Enhanced-Harvest-Analysis
Analysis of the effectiveness of enhancement for harvest objectives  

There are several 'data wrangling' scripts and one main analysis script. The main analyses can be found in the 'enh_ctr_analyses.Rmd'.  
   
catch_data_wrangle.Rmd: tidies and organizes catch data (commercial, rec, and hatchery) from multiple sources into single usable files for subsequent analyses  
  
chum_wrange.Rmd: tidies and organizes the data provided by Cheryl Lynch from the 2020 Chum Assessment, including catch and escapement data as well as mark mortality rates  
  
mark_rates.Rmd: looks at hatchery releases to determine proportions released with coded wire tags, those untagged but associated with a CWT release group, and those untagged and unassociated with a CWT.  
  
objectives.Rmd: brings in production plans from 2014-2021 and combines them, pulling out primary objectives for target releases  
  
CTC_enh_ctr.Rmd: an exploratory look at Chinook Technical Committee (CTC) data on catch and mortality distributions to try to determine enhanced contributions  
  
enc_ctr_analyses.Rmd: contains the main analyses for the PSF Harvest Effectiveness Review and appendices, including plots/tables of total catch, total hatchery catch, enhanced contribution to catch, CWT catch distributions, and catch efficicency for Chinook and Coho, with a few analyses for Chum where possible.
